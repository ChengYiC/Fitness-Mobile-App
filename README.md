# Fitness-Mobile-App
 (Group project) Use Android Studio and Java to write an Android app.
 
We want to develop a fitness android application for those people who want to maintain a daily workout routine but are tight on budget or donâ€™t want to spend precious free-time on the way to the gym. It offers sessions developed by certified professional personal trainers vidoes. It will calculate the calories burned based on the exercise. Then it will record caloric intake from meals, snacks and drinks and get the net intake of calories. Based on the user's goals and body information, it also provides a meal plan to make sure that the food users consume gives their body what it needs.
